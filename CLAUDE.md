# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Project Does

DLNA Gateway is a Python-based UPnP/DLNA music library gateway. It discovers UPnP MediaServers (AssetUPnP, MinimServer, Jellyfin, Plex) on the local network, indexes their music into a local SQLite DB, and exposes a PWA web UI for browsing and playback. Playback targets: UPnP MediaRenderers (Naim Uniti, etc.) and browser audio. The gateway also announces itself as a UPnP MediaServer so UPnP renderers can browse its playlists directly.

## Running the Gateway

```bash
./setup.sh --run                   # set up venv + start on :8765
./setup.sh --run --no-browser      # skip auto-open
./setup.sh --run --debug           # verbose logging
./setup.sh --run --probe http://...  # add a server manually
./setup.sh --run --list-devices    # show known devices table
./setup.sh --run --reset-devices   # clear device DB
```

## Running Tests

Four complementary layers:

```bash
python tests/run_all.py              # full backend suite: grep + live + unit tests
python tests/run_all.py --offline    # file-level checks only (no server needed)
python tests/run_all.py --frontend   # backend suite + Playwright UI suite
python tests/run_all.py --frontend-only  # just the Playwright UI suite (fastest iteration)
python tests/run_all.py http://192.168.1.x:8765  # custom gateway URL

# Layer 1 — behavioural unit tests (no network, <1s):
python3 -m unittest tests.test_player tests.test_api_playback -v

# Layer 2 — Playwright UI suite (~75s, no live gateway needed):
.venv/bin/pytest tests/frontend -v
.venv/bin/pytest tests/frontend -k transport --headed   # visible browser, single panel

# Layer 3 — chaos simulator (live gateway, randomized + adversarial):
python3 tests/chaos.py --iterations 500 --workers 4
python3 tests/chaos.py --seed 42 --quiet    # reproduce a past failure
```

### Frontend test architecture (`tests/frontend/`)

The Playwright suite never touches the live gateway — it boots a Python
stub (`stub_gateway.py`) on an ephemeral port that serves the real
`static/` files and mocks every `/api/*` endpoint app.js calls. Each test
gets a fresh stub instance via the `gateway` fixture (state) plus a
Playwright `app` (desktop, 1280×800) or `mobile_app` (iPhone-sized,
375×667) page.

Add a button-or-feature test by appending to the right `test_<panel>.py`.
The stub captures every request into `gateway.requests`, so assertions
of the form *"clicking X must POST {body} to /api/Y"* are one-liners:
`gateway.wait_for_request("/api/Y", method="POST", match=lambda r: ...)`.
Call `gateway.clear_requests()` before the user action so stale init
calls don't false-match.

`chaos.py` hard-fails if it sees any 5xx, `/tmp/dlna-gateway.err` grows (= silent thread death), or a snapshot takes >5s. Its first real-world find was the `playlist_tracks.duration` HH:MM:SS-string `ValueError` that was killing the renderer-queue daemon thread invisibly.

Each core module also has a standalone self-test:

```bash
python dlna_config.py              # config/logging
python dlna_discovery.py           # SSDP discovery (20s live scan)
python dlna_content.py <control-url>  # UPnP SOAP
python dlna_library.py             # DB operations
python db_pool.py                  # concurrent DB stress test
python dlna_player.py              # QueueRegistry + duration-parser self-test
python dlna_server.py              # HTTP server (30s on :8766)
```

## Architecture

### Entry Point & Thread Model

`dlna_gateway.py:main()` wires all modules and spawns these daemon threads:
1. SSDP multicast listener (MediaServer + MediaRenderer discovery)
2. Pre-prober (re-probes known servers cached in DB on startup)
3. Subnet scanner (fallback if SSDP finds nothing)
4. Heartbeat thread (marks devices offline after 2 consecutive failures)
5. Gateway SSDP announcer (broadcasts gateway itself as a MediaServer)
6. HTTP server (ThreadingMixIn, handles all API and static file requests)
7. Optional HTTPS server (separate thread, redirects HTTP→HTTPS)

### Module Responsibilities

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `dlna_gateway.py` | Main entry point, wires modules, starts all threads |
| `dlna_server.py` | Threaded HTTP server; delegates routing to `dlna_routes` |
| `dlna_routes.py` | `GET_ROUTES` / `POST_ROUTES` path → handler maps |
| `dlna_discovery.py` | SSDP listener, probe, subnet scanner, server heartbeat |
| `dlna_registry.py` | Data classes + `ServerRegistry` / `RendererRegistry` thread-safe stores |
| `dlna_library.py` | `LibraryDB` — SQLite index + FTS5 search + playlists; composition root for DB-owning singletons |
| `dlna_indexer.py` | `Indexer` — background crawler that walks a MediaServer and populates LibraryDB |
| `dlna_art_fetcher.py` | `AlbumArtFetcher` — Phase B MusicBrainz + Cover Art Archive lookup |
| `dlna_devices.py` | `DeviceRoleCache` — in-memory mirror of device_roles for zero-latency classification |
| `db_pool.py` | SQLite connection pool — WAL mode, thread-local connections, write serialization |
| `dlna_config.py` | Constants (`DB_FILE`, `CFG_FILE`, `LOG_FILE`), logging setup, config load/save |
| `dlna_content.py` | UPnP ContentDirectory SOAP client (`cd_browse`, `cd_search`) |
| `dlna_avtransport.py` | UPnP AVTransport SOAP client (send/stop/pause/state/position) |
| `dlna_player.py` | `RendererQueue` (sequential playback per renderer) + `QueueRegistry` (one queue per UDN) |
| `dlna_stream_proxy.py` | Browser-audio HTTP proxy (`/stream`) with 5-min idle timeout |
| `api_browse.py` | Browse/search API endpoints |
| `api_playback.py` | Playback, stream proxy route, `/art`, `/api/client_log`, state, indexer management |
| `api_playlists.py` | Playlist CRUD endpoints |
| `api_upnp.py` | UPnP service descriptors + SOAP ContentDirectory (for Naim Uniti browsing gateway playlists) |

### Key Module-Level Singletons

These are shared state across all request handler threads:

- `dlna_discovery.SERVERS` / `RENDERERS` — device registries
- `dlna_library.DB` / `INDEXER` / `DEVICE_ROLES` — library DB, crawler, device role cache
- `dlna_player.QUEUES` — `QueueRegistry` holding one `RendererQueue` per renderer UDN (lazily created). Replaces the prior single-queue singleton so multiple users/renderers can play concurrently.

### Database Schema

SQLite at `library.db`, WAL mode, accessed via `db_pool.Pool`:

```
tracks(id, udn, obj_id, url, title, artist, album, duration, art, mime, genre, file_path)
  UNIQUE(udn, artist, album, title)
tracks_fts — FTS5 virtual table over (title, artist, album)
metadata_overrides(url, artist, album, title, genre, updated_at)
index_meta(udn, indexed_at)
playlists(id, name, created_at, sort_order)
playlist_tracks(id, pl_id, url, title, artist, album, duration, art, added_at)
  UNIQUE(pl_id, url)
device_roles(udn, name, location, host, is_server, is_renderer, first_seen, last_seen)
album_art(artist, album, art_url, source, updated_at)
  PRIMARY KEY (artist, album)
  source ∈ {'sibling', 'musicbrainz', 'notfound', 'manual'}
play_counts(url, count, last_played)
  PRIMARY KEY (url)
  Incremented by LibraryDB.radio_tracks(); persists across rebuild-index.
```

### Frontend

`static/index.html` + `static/app.js` (PWA, ~71K lines). Communicates with backend via `/api/*` JSON endpoints. Features: letter bar, browse modes, playlist management, MediaSession API, Service Worker offline support. Dark theme with amber accents (`static/app.css`).

### Concurrency Notes

- All DB writes are serialized through `db_pool`'s write lock; reads use thread-local connections in WAL mode.
- SOAP calls to UPnP servers are throttled by a semaphore (max 3 concurrent) in `dlna_content.py` to avoid overwhelming servers like AssetUPnP.
- Device registries use `threading.Lock` for thread-safe access.
- `RendererQueue.snapshot()` is cached for 500ms and coalesced across concurrent callers: only the first cache-miss fires SOAP; subsequent callers during the fetch return the stale cache immediately rather than block. Prevents N polling browser tabs from stacking N SOAP round-trips.
- The two SOAP calls inside `snapshot()` (GetTransportInfo + GetPositionInfo) run in parallel threads — halves snapshot latency under load, caps at ~6s on an unresponsive renderer instead of 12s.
- Worker threads kicked off by `/api/render_queue` are wrapped in `_start_safe()` with `log.exception` so any crash inside `RendererQueue.start()` lands in `gateway.log`, not silently in `/tmp/dlna-gateway.err`.

### Concurrent playback model

Each renderer (UDN) owns its own `RendererQueue` in `QUEUES`. Architectural rule: one active stream per physical output, enforced server-side.

- `POST /api/render_queue` with `{udn, tracks}` → 200 if that renderer is idle.
- `POST /api/render_queue` while that UDN is already playing → **409 Conflict** with body `{error: "renderer_busy", busy_with: {title, artist, renderer}}`.
- Client resends with `{udn, tracks, force: true}` to take over — this stops the prior session and starts the new queue.
- The UI (`sendRenderQueue()` in `app.js`) catches the 409 and shows a native `confirm()`: "X is already playing Y — Take over?".
- Different UDNs are fully independent: queuing on renderer A doesn't touch renderer B's state. Per-UDN concurrency is proven by `tests/test_api_playback.py::test_concurrent_renderers_have_independent_state`.

### Browser-audio stream proxy

`proxy_stream()` in `dlna_player.py` relays bytes from the media server to the browser over a single HTTP connection with Range support.

- `PROXY_IDLE_SEC = 300` (module-level so tests can monkey-patch) — if the browser stops consuming bytes for 5 minutes (laptop suspended, tab closed without clean FIN), the proxy tears down the upstream connection. On laptop wake, the user starts playback again from the beginning; there's no resume.
- Every session logs `proxy_stream ▶ START host/path` and `proxy_stream ■ END host/path sent=N bytes in Xs reason=<r>` with reason ∈ `{upstream_eof, client_idle_timeout, client_closed, error:<Type>}`.
- The gateway is NOT in the audio path for UPnP renderers (the renderer streams directly from AssetUPnP); the proxy only matters for browser-audio playback.
- No HTTP keep-alive — `Connection: close` on both ends. Each browser Range request opens a new upstream TCP connection. On LAN this is ~1ms; on Tailscale it's ~50-100ms per seek. Acceptable for current load; would need a connection pool if users start complaining about seek latency over the tailnet.

### `/art` — lock-screen artwork proxy

iOS MediaSession refuses to load cross-origin artwork on the lock screen. The PWA rewrites every track art URL to `/art?url=<external>` so the lock-screen fetch is same-origin. Service Worker cache-firsts these (art rarely changes).

- Hard-caps at 5 MB per image to prevent memory abuse.
- Validates Content-Type starts with `image/` — an upstream HTML 404 page won't poison the SW cache.
- 10-second timeout; slow upstream fails fast.
- The handler is in `api_playback.art()` routed at `/art` in `dlna_server.py`.

### Browser audio error handling (MediaError discrimination)

`static/app.js` listens for `error` events on the `<audio>` element and branches on `MediaError.code`:

| code | name              | behavior                                                      |
|------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | ABORTED           | ignored (we or the UA told it to stop)                        |
| 2    | NETWORK           | retry the same track ONCE (transient network), then skip      |
| 3    | DECODE            | retry the same track ONCE (could be a bad Range chunk), skip  |
| 4    | SRC_NOT_SUPPORTED | skip immediately — the format genuinely isn't playable        |

Prior to 2026-04-23 every `error` event was treated as code 4 and auto-skipped, producing false-positive "unsupported format" skips whenever the network hiccupped. Every event (including ignored-code-1) is now POSTed to `/api/client_log` so real-world incidents land in `gateway.log` for diagnosis.

### `_playBrowserAudio()` — autoplay-rejection-aware play()

Every call to `browserAudio.play()` now routes through this helper instead of `audio.play().catch(()=>{})`. When the browser rejects with `NotAllowedError` (autoplay blocked, first-play without gesture, iOS standalone resume) or `AbortError`, the helper:
1. Resets the play button UI so the user can manually re-trigger.
2. Toasts "⚠ Browser blocked playback — tap ▶ Play to start".
3. POSTs a `play_rejected` event to `/api/client_log` with the error name + UA.

Before this, blocked autoplay was invisible: the UI showed "⏸ Pause", no audio, no error surfaced.

### `/api/client_log` — browser-side observability

POST-only endpoint that logs free-form JSON reports from the PWA into `gateway.log` under the `dlna.client` logger:

```
grep "dlna.client" gateway.log         # all browser-reported events
grep "client_log\[audio_error" gw.log  # just MediaError events
grep "client_log\[play_rejected" gw.log # just autoplay blocks
```

Payload fields are clamped defensively (40 chars for `kind`, 120 for fields, 200 for `message`, 80 for `ua`) so a broken or malicious client can't flood the log. Handler in `api_playback.client_log()`.

### HTTPS / Tailscale cert

The gateway auto-detects `*.crt` + `*.key` in the working directory on startup. Currently uses a Tailscale-issued Let's Encrypt cert: `ronsmacmini.tail5be6ad.ts.net.{crt,key}`. Mobile devices on the tailnet get a trusted cert with no install or exception needed.

**Cert renewal is NOT automated.** Tailscale-issued certs are valid 90 days. To renew:

```bash
cd ~/dlna-gateway
tailscale cert ronsmacmini.tail5be6ad.ts.net   # writes new .crt + .key
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.roha.dlna-gateway
```

Set a calendar reminder; an expired cert will make mobile PWA access fail silently (browser blocks with "not private" warning). When it breaks, `gateway.log` shows `HTTPS failed to start: ...` or continues to serve with the expired cert — the gateway doesn't check expiry.

### Mobile / PWA testing checklist

Because there's no automated test coverage for on-device behavior (iOS Safari, Android Chrome, PWA standalone mode), before believing a browser-mode change is shipped, manually verify on an actual mobile device over Tailscale:

1. **Fresh PWA install**: Safari → Share → Add to Home Screen. Icon + title use manifest values.
2. **First-play autoplay**: Tap a track. Audio starts. (If it doesn't, and a toast says "Browser blocked playback", that's the correct new behavior — the `catch` surfaces it.)
3. **Lock screen artwork**: Lock the phone during playback. Album art shown on lock screen. Previous/Next/Play/Pause work.
4. **Tab backgrounded**: Switch to another app. Audio continues. (If it pauses, that's iOS's audio-session policy, not a bug.)
5. **Laptop/phone suspend during stream**: Close lid (or long-press sleep). Wait 5+ min. Check `gateway.log` shows `proxy_stream ■ END ... reason=client_idle_timeout` within 6 minutes.
6. **Error reporting**: After playback fails (e.g., play an unsupported-format track), `grep dlna.client gateway.log` should show the event with `codeName=unsupported` etc.
7. **Rebuild / force-refresh**: Pull-to-refresh in PWA. Service Worker updates (check DevTools Application tab → SW version).

When something goes wrong, the diagnostic order is (1) `gateway.log` `dlna.client` entries for browser-side events, (2) `/tmp/dlna-gateway.err` for server-thread crashes, (3) Safari DevTools Web Inspector for pre-report JS errors.

## Dependencies

All optional — the gateway degrades gracefully if missing:

```
rich>=13.7.0              # colored terminal logging
python-json-logger>=2.0.7 # structured JSON logging
```

Standard library only for core UPnP functionality. `requirements.txt` still lists `PyChromecast` but Chromecast support was removed (commit `2a8d81e`); the package is not imported anywhere and can be dropped on next cleanup pass.

## Album art persistence (Phase A + Phase B)

Album covers are cached in a dedicated `album_art` table, keyed by `(artist, album)`, independent of `tracks`. This means a rebuild-index is non-destructive to art:

```
album_art(artist, album, art_url, source, updated_at)
  PRIMARY KEY (artist, album)
  source ∈ {'sibling', 'musicbrainz', 'notfound', 'manual'}
```

### How it fills up

- **Phase A — sibling harvest** (`dlna_library.LibraryDB._backfill_album_art`): instantaneous SQL pass. Runs at end of every `upsert_tracks(udn, rows)` call (i.e. after each indexer run) and once at startup as a migration. Harvests per-album art from tracks that brought their own art (source = `'sibling'`) and applies it onto sibling tracks of the same `(artist, album)` that were missing one.
- **Phase B — external lookup** (`dlna_library.AlbumArtFetcher`, singleton `ART_FETCHER`): event-driven background worker. Fires on two hooks only — (1) a one-shot startup scan 120s after boot (`ART_FETCHER.start_initial_scan()` in `dlna_gateway.main`) to catch albums left bare by a previous interrupted run, and (2) `ART_FETCHER.trigger()` at the tail of every successful `Indexer._run()` so new bare albums from a fresh crawl get looked up immediately. No periodic poll. Walks `bare_albums()` (tracks with no art AND no `album_art` row of any source), queries MusicBrainz release-group → HEADs `coverartarchive.org/release-group/{mbid}/front-500`, writes hits as `source='musicbrainz'` and misses as `source='notfound'`. Rate-limited to ~1 req/sec (`_MB_RATE_LIMIT_SEC = 1.1`) per MusicBrainz ToS. If a trigger arrives while a scan is in flight, it's a no-op — the ongoing `run_once()` re-queries `bare_albums()` between batches and absorbs the new work into the current pass.

### What survives a rebuild-index

The `album_art` cache persists across rebuild-index operations — only the `tracks` table gets wiped and repopulated. After an `upsert_tracks()` call:

1. The fresh `tracks` rows may bring new per-album art from the server → harvested into `album_art` (source=`'sibling'`).
2. `_backfill_album_art(conn, udn=udn)` applies existing `album_art` URLs onto the new tracks that lack one.
3. Brand-new albums not yet in the cache become bare. At the end of `Indexer._run()` (success path), `ART_FETCHER.trigger()` fires and the MB/CAA lookup runs in a background thread. Hits are written into `album_art` AND straight onto `tracks.art` via an UPDATE within `run_once()`, so the now-playing window and any future playlist queries pick them up without another indexer pass. After a gateway restart, the 120s-post-startup scan picks up anything that an earlier run couldn't finish.

### Sticky "notfound" cache

The negative cache is sticky by design — once MusicBrainz failed to match an album, `AlbumArtFetcher` skips it forever so re-indexing doesn't re-hammer MB for the same misses. If you've since fixed artist/album metadata in the source server and want to retry, delete the notfound row(s):

```sql
-- Retry a single album
DELETE FROM album_art WHERE source='notfound' AND artist='…' AND album='…';

-- Retry everything MB missed previously
DELETE FROM album_art WHERE source='notfound';
```

Those albums become bare again and get looked up on the next `ART_FETCHER.trigger()` — which means either a rebuild-index of any server, or a gateway restart (the 120s startup scan).

## Restarting the gateway

The gateway runs under launchd (LaunchAgent `com.roha.dlna-gateway`). To restart:

```bash
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.roha.dlna-gateway
```

`kill <pid> && ./setup.sh --run` is wrong — launchd will respawn the old copy before the manual one starts, leading to port conflicts.

## Renderer playback diagnostics

Each `RendererQueue` (one per renderer UDN in `QUEUES`) emits a fixed-format per-track line for every start and end, regardless of the reason. Greppable prefixes:

```
RendererQueue ▶ START [idx/total] 'title' — artist / album (durS) → renderer
RendererQueue ■ END   [idx/total] 'title' played NNs/durS reason=<reason>
RendererQueue ✗ SEND FAILED [idx/total] 'title' — SetURI/Play returned False (url=…)
RendererQueue ⚠ ABORT N consecutive send failures — stopping queue
```

Reason tags on END lines:

| reason | Where it comes from |
|---|---|
| `finished` | Renderer state went PLAYING → STOPPED naturally (end of track) |
| `user_next` | `QUEUES.get(udn).next_track()` — UI pressed Next |
| `user_prev` | `QUEUES.get(udn).prev_track()` — UI pressed Prev |
| `user_stop` | `QUEUES.get(udn).stop()` — UI pressed Stop |
| `queue_replaced` | `QUEUES.get(udn).start()` — a new queue was posted while the old one was still playing (includes the "force take over" path) |
| `send_failed` | `avtransport_send()` returned False (SOAP fault on SetURI or Play) |

### Why SEND FAILED matters

Previously `_send_current()` ignored the return value of `avtransport_send()`. When SetURI failed, the renderer stayed STOPPED, the monitor saw STOPPED, called `_advance()`, sent the next track, which also failed — silently chewing through every track in the queue until the user hit kickstart. The symptom was "all 35 songs skipped, nothing in the log, only a restart fixes it."

The fix has two parts:
1. `_send_current()` now checks the SOAP return and emits `✗ SEND FAILED` with the track URL for every failure.
2. `RendererQueue._MAX_CONSECUTIVE_FAILS = 5` caps the damage: after 5 consecutive SetURI/Play failures the queue aborts itself with `⚠ ABORT`. A transient blip (1–4 failures) auto-advances past the bad track and resets the counter on the next success.

### Duration parsing (`_dur_to_sec`)

Track durations in `playlist_tracks` are stored as TEXT in UPnP `H:MM:SS(.fff)` format, NOT as seconds. `_dur_to_sec()` in `dlna_player.py` tolerates every format the DB stores (int, float, empty/None, `H:MM:SS.fff`, `MM:SS`, malformed strings → 0). Prior to 2026-04-23 this was `int(dur)` and blew up silently inside the daemon thread, killing playback before SetURI was ever sent. Regression-guarded by `tests/test_player.py::TestDurToSec` and `TestRendererQueueDurationSafety`.

## Radio play-count biasing

`GET /api/radio?udn=X&limit=N` (handler: `api_browse.radio` → `LibraryDB.radio_tracks`) picks N tracks biased toward **lowest play count** with random tiebreak, then atomically bumps the count on all selected URLs. The same 100 never keep surfacing: over time the whole library cycles through.

```
SELECT ... FROM tracks t
  LEFT JOIN play_counts p ON p.url = t.url
 WHERE t.udn = ?
 ORDER BY COALESCE(p.count, 0) ASC, RANDOM()
 LIMIT ?
```

The `play_counts` table is intentionally decoupled from `tracks`:

- **Not touched by `clear(udn)`** — rebuild-index doesn't reset play history, same invariant as `album_art`.
- **Keyed by URL** — if the upstream media server ever re-hashes URLs, orphaned rows are harmless and those tracks restart at count=0. Soft preference, not a correctness invariant.
- **Radio-only tracking** — listening via browse / playlists / favourites does NOT increment; only `/api/radio` does. Keeps the feature self-contained and matches the "radio freshness" use case.

To force a full reset (hear early picks again):

```sql
DELETE FROM play_counts;
```

Tests: `tests/test_library.py::TestRadioPlayCountBias` covers the invariants — disjoint-from-prior-call, full-library cycling, persistence across `clear()`.

## External services (outbound HTTP)

The gateway is LAN-only except for album-art lookups. Two hosts are contacted, both over TLS:

| Host | Purpose | Method + path |
|---|---|---|
| `musicbrainz.org` | Resolve `(artist, album)` → release-group MBID | `GET /ws/2/release-group/?query=…&fmt=json&limit=5` |
| `coverartarchive.org` | Confirm a front cover exists for that MBID | `HEAD /release-group/{mbid}/front-500` — 200/301/302/307 counts as "have it", 404 counts as "no cover" |

Required contract:

- **User-Agent** — `_MB_USER_AGENT = "DLNAGateway/1.0 ( hintt@me.com )"` in `dlna_library.py`. MusicBrainz's ToS demands an identifying UA with contact info; anonymous calls get 403-blocked.
- **Rate limit** — `_MB_RATE_LIMIT_SEC = 1.1` between calls, enforced in `AlbumArtFetcher.run_once()`. MB allows 1 req/sec sustained; 1.1s gives a small safety margin.
- **Timeout** — `_MB_TIMEOUT = 10.0` per connection. Exceptions inside `_mb_lookup_cover()` are caught and returned as `None` (album gets cached as `notfound`).
- **No retries** — a transient failure ends up as `notfound` and stays sticky; see the "Sticky notfound cache" subsection above for how to force a retry.

## Loudness normalization (Phase 1, in flight)

Every track gets analysed once with `ffmpeg -af ebur128`, the integrated
loudness (LUFS) is stored, and a per-track gain is applied on playback so
all tracks sit at the same reference loudness. **Phase 1 covers UPnP
renderers only** (Naim Uniti is the primary device). Browser-audio Web
Audio gain is deferred to Phase 2.

### Reference target

`TARGET_LUFS = -18.0` — audiophile / max-headroom. Quiet classical stays
present; loud rock gets attenuated rather than chasing the user's amp
into clipping. Defined in `dlna_loudness.py`.

### `track_loudness` table — survives `clear(udn)`

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS track_loudness (
  url        TEXT PRIMARY KEY,   -- matches tracks.url; orphans harmless
  lufs       REAL,               -- measured integrated loudness; NULL on scan failure
  gain_db    REAL DEFAULT 0.0,   -- = TARGET_LUFS - lufs (clamped ±20)
  scanned_at INTEGER NOT NULL    -- epoch seconds
);
```

Same persistence pattern as `album_art` and `play_counts` — independent
of `tracks`, so a rebuild-index doesn't trigger a full re-scan.
**`clear(udn)` deliberately leaves this table alone.**

### `LoudnessScanner` background worker

Mirrors `AlbumArtFetcher` (see `dlna_art_fetcher.py:98-212`). Public
surface in `dlna_loudness.py`:

- `bare_tracks() → [(url, file_path), …]` — tracks with `file_path != ''`
  and no `track_loudness` row.
- `run_once()` — drain in batches of 50; re-queries between batches so
  triggers arriving mid-run are absorbed into the current pass.
- `_analyze(file_path)` — subprocess `ffmpeg -nostats -i {path} -af
  ebur128=framelog=quiet -f null -`, parse `Integrated loudness: -X.X
  LUFS`. Returns `None` on parse failure.
- `trigger()` / `start_initial_scan(delay=120)` / `stop()` — same
  contract as `ART_FETCHER`.

CPU posture: **single thread, `os.nice(10)`.** ~1 sec per track. A
5000-track library is ~80 min once; subsequent runs hit only new tracks.

### Sticky negative cache

Failed scans (unreadable file, ffmpeg crash) get a row with `lufs=NULL,
gain_db=0.0` so we don't retry every restart — same convention as
`album_art.source='notfound'`. To force a retry on a single track:

```sql
DELETE FROM track_loudness WHERE url = '...' AND lufs IS NULL;
```

### UPnP `RenderingControl` — new SOAP helpers

Added to `dlna_avtransport.py` (the service is distinct from
AVTransport):

- `set_volume(rc_url, level: int) → bool` — clamped 0-100; sends
  `urn:schemas-upnp-org:service:RenderingControl:1#SetVolume` with
  `Channel=Master`.
- `get_volume(rc_url) → int | None` — used **once per RendererQueue**
  on first play to adopt whatever the user has set on the renderer's
  own remote as the reference.

The renderer's RenderingControl URL is sourced from the device
description XML during discovery (`dlna_discovery.py` extends
`_RendererInfo`).

### Per-track gain via SetVolume

`dlna_player.py` constant: `GAIN_TO_VOLUME_RATIO = 2` (one Naim
volume-unit ≈ 0.5 dB; **approximation** — the renderer's curve is
logarithmic and renderer-specific). Tune by ear after first listen.

`RendererQueue._send_current()` (the per-track hook):

1. If `self._user_volume is None` → `get_volume(rc_url)` once, cache.
2. Look up `gain_db = DB.gain_db_for_url(t["url"])`.
3. `level = clamp(0, 100, _user_volume + round(gain_db *
   GAIN_TO_VOLUME_RATIO))`.
4. `set_volume(rc_url, level)` → then `avtransport_send` (SetURI+Play).

### `/api/control` UPnP volume

Previously rejected with "Unknown device" (api_playback.py:273).
Implemented:

```
POST /api/control
{"action": "volume", "value": 65, "device": "upnp:<udn>"}
```

→ `QUEUES.get(udn).set_user_volume(65)` — pushes immediately to the
renderer AND updates the reference for next-track gain math.

### `/api/loudness/status` — visibility endpoint

```json
{ "scanned": 1234, "total": 4321, "in_progress": true,
  "target_lufs": -18.0 }
```

Routed via `dlna_routes.GET_ROUTES`; future PWA work will surface the
progress in the index bar.

### Caveats

- **Gateway is not in the audio path for Naim** — we can only adjust
  SetVolume; we cannot apply DSP. This is a hardware reality, not a
  limitation of the approach.
- **The Naim's own remote will fight us.** A nudge on the Naim's remote
  is undone on the next track's `set_volume`. Document; not solvable
  without a poll-then-adjust loop that itself would lag.
- **Renderer volume curve is non-linear** — `GAIN_TO_VOLUME_RATIO = 2`
  is a guess; tune by ear.

### Tests

| File | What it covers |
|---|---|
| `tests/test_loudness.py` | 15 tests — `_parse_ebur128`, `bare_tracks` query (excludes empty file_path / already-scanned / negative-cache), `clear(udn)` survival, `run_once` writes lufs+gain, failed-scan negative cache, gain clamped ±20 dB, `trigger()` idempotent, `start_initial_scan`, `gain_db_for_url` helper |
| `tests/test_avtransport_volume.py` | 9 tests — `set_volume` body shape (RenderingControl namespace, `<Channel>Master</Channel>`, `<DesiredVolume>`), clamping 0/100, SOAP-fault and connection-error paths; `get_volume` parses `<CurrentVolume>`, returns None on fault/garbled/error |
| `tests/test_player_volume.py` | 9 tests — first play calls GetVolume once then SetVolume, subsequent tracks skip GetVolume, gain math with RATIO=2, clamp at 0/100, no-row → reference passed through, `set_user_volume` updates reference + fires SetVolume immediately and is sticky for next track |
| `tests/frontend/test_vol_extras.py` | Extended: tighter UPnP volume body assertion (`device="upnp:<udn>"` required); new `test_loudness_status_endpoint` asserts `/api/loudness/status` shape |
| `tests/run_all.py` | Live-gateway integration: `GET /api/loudness/status` returns the four expected fields with right types |
