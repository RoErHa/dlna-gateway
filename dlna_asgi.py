dlna_asgi.py — 2.0 ASGI application (FastAPI), served by Hypercorn.

Phase 2 of the 2.0 transport refresh (docs/BUILDING_2.0_SIDE_BY_SIDE.md):
migrate the stdlib `BaseHTTPRequestHandler` gateway (dlna_server.py +
dlna_routes.py) onto an async ASGI app served by Hypercorn — HTTP/2-capable,
async I/O, and a path to WebSocket/SSE (R2). The migration is INCREMENTAL:
routes are ported batch-by-batch from the legacy handlers, and the app stays
runnable + test-green at every step. This module begins as a SKELETON with a
single native route to prove the stack; it grows as handlers move over.

Run it (from the 2.0 worktree):
    .venv/bin/hypercorn dlna_asgi:app --bind 127.0.0.1:8768
    # or, programmatically:  python dlna_asgi.py   (boots Hypercorn on :8768)
    # interactive API docs:  http://127.0.0.1:8768/api/docs

Behind `tailscale serve` the backend is plain HTTP/1.1 on localhost; h2/h3
to clients comes from the front (or, later, from Hypercorn's own TLS).
